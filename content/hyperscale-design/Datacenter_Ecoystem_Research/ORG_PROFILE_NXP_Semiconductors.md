## PAGE 3 OF 6: OT SECURITY ANALYSIS & REGULATORY EXPOSURE

### 3.1 Cybersecurity Certification Status

| Product Line / Division | IEC 62443-4-1 | IEC 62443-4-2 | ISO 27001 | SOC 2 Type II |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Connected Gateways** | No | No | No | No |
| **Embedded Controllers** | No | No | No | No |
| **Cloud Monitoring** | No | No | Partial | No |

**Security Program Profile:** The company has a significant lack of public product security certifications. No verified IEC 62443 certifications exist for the core connected product lines. Product security is managed within engineering and IT compliance portfolios.

### 3.2 EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) Exposure
Connected controllers, gateways, and monitoring software fall directly within the scope of products with digital elements:
*   **Connected Controllers & Gateways:** Classified as Class II (Important) products due to their role in critical facility control.
*   **Compliance Timeline:** Requirements are mandatory by December 2027.
*   **Penalties:** Fines up to 2.5% of global annual turnover for non-compliance.

### 3.3 Infrastructure Regulations (NERC CIP & NIS2)
*   **NERC CIP:** Applicable when these systems are deployed in electric generation or transmission assets in North America.
*   **NIS2 Directive:** European divisions supply data centers and critical industrial facilities. The company meets size thresholds and must comply with European supply chain standards.
*   **GDPR:** Data collected via cloud platforms is subject to GDPR and local privacy controls.

### 3.4 Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities & Incidents
Vulnerability activity details:
*   **Known Vulnerabilities:** No critical CVE records disclosed in the last 24 months.
*   **Vulnerability Management:** Vulnerability routing is handled via email or security portals, but public SLA metrics are generally absent.

## PAGE 4 OF 6: STRATEGIC CONTEXT & GROWTH SIGNALS

### 4.1 Data Center Market Expansion
The company is shifting resources toward hyperscale and colocation data center markets, aiming to capture demand from high-density computing:
*   **AI Infrastructure Demand:** Large-scale deployments require certified, highly secure infrastructure components.
*   **Technology Gap:** Lack of public product security certifications and SBOM disclosures creates a major sales barrier for hyperscale customers.

### 4.2 Competitive Position

| Product Segment | Market Position | Key Competitors | Strategic Advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Data Center Infrastructure** | Tier 2 / Leader | Honeywell, Schneider, Siemens | Custom engineering, global service network |

---

## PAGE 5 OF 6: KEY PERSONNEL & ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE

### 5.1 Executive Leadership

| Name | Title | Scope of Responsibility | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Rafael Sotomayor** | President & CEO | Group | Netherlands |
| **William Betz** | CFO | Finance | USA |
| **Lars Reger** | CTO | R&D | Germany |
| **Joppe W. Bos** | Technical Director, Competence Center Crypto | Product Security | Belgium |

### 5.2 Product Security Governance
*   **CISO Role Status:** Dedicated CISO is absent or not publicly named. Information security resides under legal, compliance, or CIO portfolios.
*   **PSIRT Function:** A formal PSIRT is either absent or operates with limited public visibility, routing vulnerability reports to R&D engineering.

---

## PAGE 6 OF 6: CUSTOMERS, VALUE CHAIN & TETREL ENGAGEMENT PLAN

### 6.1 Primary Customer Segments
*   **Hyperscale Cloud Operators:** Targeted for infrastructure cooling, fire safety, or access control systems.
*   **Critical Infrastructure:** Government facilities, transport networks, and utility installations.

### 6.2 Value Chain & Sourcing
*   **Manufacturing Footprint:** Sourcing is distributed across global assembly plants, using contract manufacturers and specialized Tier-1 components.
*   **Supplier Base:** Uses standard processors and network chipsets.

### 6.3 Tetrel Engagement Strategy

#### Priority Score: ★★★★★ (5/5) - Critical Target

**Targeting Rationale:**
1.  **CRA Class II Exposure:** Connected controllers and gateways fall within Class II CRA scope, requiring certification.
2.  **Product Security Deficit:** Lack of dedicated product security leadership and public PSIRT creates procurement friction.
3.  **Data Center Scale-up:** Selling to hyperscale data centers requires immediate secure SDLC and SBOM implementation.

#### Recommended Outreach Sequence
*   Week 1: Contact Technical Director Joppe W. Bos. Offer post-quantum cryptanalytic validation services.
*   Week 2: Contact CTO Lars Reger. Present automated SBOM generation frameworks.
*   Week 3: Connect with CEO Rafael Sotomayor. Discuss CRA compliance risk for their European chip supply.

#### Proposed Service Packages

| Service Package | Scope | Price (CAD) | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Semiconductor SBOM Automation Plan** | Build automated CycloneDX SBOM generation into the i.MX and LPC SDK compiler toolchains | $125,000 | 5 weeks |
| **Post-Quantum Crypto Audit** | Evaluate EdgeLock secure elements against NIST post-quantum cryptographic standards | $140,000 | 6 weeks |
| **CRA Article 3(1) Conformity Review** | Verify secure boot and hardware trust anchors on i.MX9 series processors | $115,000 | 5 weeks |
