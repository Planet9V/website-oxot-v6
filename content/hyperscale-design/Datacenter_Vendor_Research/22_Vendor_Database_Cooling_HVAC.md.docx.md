## Key Takeaways

Cooling Certification Gap **Only Schneider Electric** has IEC 62443-4-2 SL-2 product certification (NMC3) for datacenter cooling infrastructure. No other cooling, liquid cooling, or heat rejection vendor has component-level certification. No vendor has OCP S.A.F.E.

Major BMS Security Incidents

- **Johnson Controls**: Dark Angels ransomware (Sep 2023), $27M+ costs, 27TB data stolen  
- **Honeywell/Tridium**: 13 Niagara Framework CVEs (Jul 2025), 1M+ installations exposed  
- **Schneider Electric**: CVE-2025-50121 (**CVSS 10.0 Critical**) RCE in EcoStruxure DCE

Market Consolidation (2023-2026)

- Schneider acquired Motivair ($850M, Oct 2024\)  
- Trane Technologies acquired LiquidStack (Mar 2026\) and BrainBox AI  
- Eaton acquired Boyd Thermal (early 2026\)  
- Flex acquired JetCool (2025)  
- Vertiv acquired CoolTera (Dec 2023\)  
- Mitsubishi Electric acquired Nozomi Networks (Sep 2025\)
