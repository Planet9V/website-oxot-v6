Artificial intelligence arrived on the plant floor without a launch date. It crept in through a vision system that a vendor bundled into an inspection cell, a predictive-maintenance module inside a drive, an "adaptive" loop in a controller firmware release. Nobody signed a policy. Nobody drew a boundary. And now AI tunes processes, grades product, forecasts failures, balances energy, and — increasingly — sits close to the safety and control functions that decide whether a line runs or trips.

The EU AI Act is the first comprehensive law in the world to govern that shift. For most people, "AI regulation" conjures chatbots and deepfakes. For an industrial operator, the provisions that bite are the quiet ones: the rules for **AI embedded in machinery, safety components and regulated products**. That is where the law reaches into operational technology, and where AI governance stops being a legal abstraction and becomes an engineering problem.

This page explains what the AI Act requires, how an industrial AI system crosses the line into "high-risk," how the law is deliberately stitched to the Machinery Regulation and the wider product-safety regime, what providers and deployers each owe, and what a proportionate response looks like in an OT environment where a manipulated model is a manipulated process.

## The short version

- The AI Act is **Regulation (EU) 2024/1689**. It entered into force on **1 August 2024** and switches on in phases. ([EUR-Lex, official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj/eng))
- It is **risk-based**: a short list of **prohibited** practices, a demanding **high-risk** tier, lighter **transparency** duties for limited-risk systems, and no new obligations for minimal-risk AI.
- Industrial AI most often becomes high-risk through **Annex I** — where the AI is a safety component of, or is itself, a product covered by EU harmonisation law such as the **Machinery Regulation**. A second route runs through **Annex III** critical-infrastructure use.
- **Providers** (who develop or place AI on the market) carry the heavy obligations; **deployers** (who use it) carry a lighter but real set of duties. Modify a system enough and a deployer *becomes* a provider.
- High-risk systems must satisfy Articles 8–15: risk management, data governance, logging, transparency, human oversight, and — the line OT teams should read twice — **accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity** under **Article 15**.
- Penalties reach **€35 million or 7% of worldwide turnover** for prohibited practices, and **€15 million or 3%** for breaching high-risk obligations. ([Article 99](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/99/))
- The high-risk deadlines were **pushed back** by the **Digital Omnibus** — politically agreed on 7 May 2026, **endorsed by the European Parliament on 16 June 2026**, and **given final adoption by the Council on 29 June 2026**, with Official Journal publication imminent. Standalone Annex III systems now apply from **2 December 2027**, and product-embedded Annex I AI from **2 August 2028**. ([Council of the EU, 29 June 2026](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2026/06/29/artificial-intelligence-council-gives-final-green-light-to-simplify-and-streamline-rules/))

> [!NOTE]
> The honest headline for industry: **most industrial AI is not high-risk.** Process optimisation, quality analytics and maintenance forecasting that never touch a safety or control function sit in the minimal tier. The real work is finding the handful of systems that *do*, classifying them correctly, and governing them without smothering the useful ninety percent.

## The risk-based structure

The Act sorts AI by the risk it poses, not by the technology it uses. A neural network and a linear model are treated identically if they do the same job in the same place. Four tiers, from banned to unregulated.

### Unacceptable risk — prohibited

A short list of practices is banned outright under **Article 5**: manipulative or exploitative techniques that distort behaviour, social scoring, untargeted scraping of facial images, emotion inference in the workplace and in education, certain biometric categorisation, and real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces (with narrow law-enforcement exceptions). These rarely surface in OT — but the prohibition is absolute wherever they do, and it carries the heaviest fine in the Act. The Digital Omnibus added one more banned practice: AI-generated non-consensual intimate imagery and child sexual abuse material, applying from **2 December 2026**. ([Winston Taylor](https://www.winstontaylor.com/insights/ai-act-rules-on-high-risk-ai-delayed-as-ai-digital-omnibus-agreed))

### High risk — permitted, but heavily regulated

This is the tier that matters for industry. High-risk systems are allowed on the market only if they meet the full set of Article 8–15 requirements and pass conformity assessment. Most industrial AI that touches a safety or control function lands here — and the rest of this page is largely about how to tell which of your systems belong in this band, and what to do about them once they do.

### Limited risk — transparency duties

Systems that interact with people or generate content must disclose it: a chatbot has to say it is a machine, synthetic media has to be labelled. This is relevant to customer-facing tools — the assistant on your website, a generated marketing image — far more than to the plant. Get the disclosure right and the obligation is discharged.

### Minimal risk — no new obligations

The vast majority of AI sits here: optimisation, analytics, energy balancing, maintenance forecasting that informs a human but does not act inside a safety loop. Subject only to voluntary codes of conduct. The tier is large on purpose — the Act was written to leave room for innovation and to concentrate scrutiny where harm is plausible.

Here is the same structure with plant-floor examples, so the tiers stop being abstract.

| Risk tier | What the law does | Typical industrial / OT examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Unacceptable** | Prohibited under Art. 5 | Emotion-inference on workers for productivity scoring; covert behaviour-manipulation. Rare in OT, banned where present. |
| **High risk** | Full Art. 8–15 requirements + conformity assessment | AI-based safety guard or light-curtain logic; vision system that halts a press; adaptive controller governing a hazardous process; AI as a safety component in grid, water, gas or heat supply. |
| **Limited risk** | Transparency / disclosure only | Operator-facing chat assistant; customer-service bot; generated documentation. |
| **Minimal risk** | No new obligations | Predictive maintenance that advises a planner; process-optimisation and yield analytics; anomaly detection that alerts a human. |

## The revised timeline — and the Digital Omnibus caveat

The AI Act was published in the Official Journal and entered into force on **1 August 2024**, with obligations phased in so that industry, notified bodies and regulators could prepare. Two milestones have already passed:

- **2 February 2025** — the **Article 5 prohibitions** applied, and organisations became responsible for a baseline of **AI literacy** among staff who operate AI systems.
- **2 August 2025** — governance provisions and the obligations for **general-purpose AI (GPAI) models** applied.

Then the timeline moved. On **7 May 2026**, negotiators from the Council, Parliament and Commission reached a provisional political agreement on the **Digital Omnibus on AI** — a simplification package that, among other things, **deferred the high-risk deadlines**. That agreement has since hardened into law: the **European Parliament endorsed it on 16 June 2026**, and the **Council gave its final green light on 29 June 2026**, with publication in the Official Journal expected within weeks and entry into force on the third day after. Under the adopted text, standalone **Annex III** high-risk systems apply from **2 December 2027** (a slip from the original 2 August 2026), and product-embedded **Annex I** AI applies from **2 August 2028**. ([Council of the EU](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2026/06/29/artificial-intelligence-council-gives-final-green-light-to-simplify-and-streamline-rules/); [White & Case](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/eu-agrees-digital-omnibus-deal-simplify-ai-rules))

> [!WARNING]
> The deferral is real and now legally grounded — but read the fine print. The Omnibus moved the *high-risk* dates; it did **not** move the prohibitions (live since February 2025), the AI-literacy duty (also live), the GPAI obligations (live since August 2025), or the transparency provisions due **2 August 2026**. If your organisation deployed anything caught by those, the extra time on high-risk does nothing for you. Plan against your specific system's route and its specific date, not against a single headline. ([Latham & Watkins](https://www.lw.com/en/insights/ai-act-update-eu-resolves-to-change-rules-and-extend-deadlines))

The deferral is a gift of time, not a reprieve. The prohibitions and AI-literacy duties are live now, the clock on high-risk classification is running, and the two slowest tasks — building an inventory and reasoning through classification — are exactly the ones you want behind you before the paperwork lands.

## How industrial AI becomes "high-risk"

There are **two distinct routes** into the high-risk tier, and they behave differently. An industrial operator needs to understand both, because a single site can be caught by either — sometimes by both at once.

### Route 1 — Annex I: product-embedded AI

Under **Article 6(1)**, an AI system is high-risk if it is used as a **safety component** of a product — or is itself a product — that is covered by the EU harmonisation legislation listed in **Annex I**, *and* that product must undergo third-party conformity assessment. Annex I is essentially a roll-call of the EU product-safety regime, and it reaches deep into industry. ([Article 6](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/6/); [Annex I explained](https://www.euai-act.com/articles/annex-i-explained))

| Annex I product legislation (selected) | Relevance to OT / industry |
|---|---|
| **Machinery** — Reg. (EU) 2023/1230 (replacing Dir. 2006/42/EC) | The headline case: AI as a machine safety component is auto high-risk. |
| Lifts — Dir. 2014/33/EU | AI in lift safety/control functions. |
| ATEX — Dir. 2014/34/EU (explosive atmospheres) | AI governing equipment in hazardous zones. |
| Pressure equipment — Dir. 2014/68/EU | AI in pressure-vessel safety systems. |
| Personal protective equipment — Reg. (EU) 2016/425 | AI-enabled PPE. |
| Medical devices / IVD — Reg. (EU) 2017/745, 2017/746 | AI in device safety — relevant to pharma/med-manufacturing. |
| Radio equipment — Dir. 2014/53/EU | Connected industrial radio/wireless. |
| Toys — Dir. 2009/48/EC | AI-enabled toy safety. |
| Motor vehicles, agricultural vehicles, aviation, marine equipment | AI safety components in mobility and transport equipment. |

The single most important consequence for OT is blunt: **an AI system that is a safety component under the Machinery Regulation is automatically a high-risk AI system.** Build or buy a machine whose safety depends on an AI component — an AI-driven guard, a vision system that trips a press, an adaptive controller that governs a hazardous process — and that AI is high-risk. Both regimes then apply to the same box at the same time.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> "Safety component" is a term of art, not a mood. If the AI's failure could increase the risk to health or safety of persons or property, it is doing safety-relevant work — regardless of whether anyone labelled it a "safety system." Vision that only sorts good product from bad is minimal-risk; the *same* vision system wired to stop a hazardous motion is a safety component. The wiring changes the classification.

### Route 2 — Annex III: listed use-cases

Article 6(2) makes systems listed in **Annex III** high-risk by their use-case. For industry, the relevant entry is **critical infrastructure**: AI intended to be used as a **safety component in the management and operation of critical digital infrastructure, road traffic, or the supply of water, gas, heating or electricity.** That is where some energy, water, heat and transport operators find their AI captured even when no discrete "machine" is involved. ([Annex III](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/annex/3/); [AI in critical infrastructure](https://www.aiactblog.nl/en/annex-iii/kritieke-infrastructuur))

Three conditions must line up for the critical-infrastructure route to bite: the AI must be intended for use as a **safety component**; the use must concern the operation of one of those listed sectors; and — per the Commission's draft classification guidance — the deploying entity is generally one designated a **critical entity** under the Critical Entities Resilience framework. ([McCann FitzGerald](https://www.mccannfitzgerald.com/knowledge/construction-and-infrastructure/critical-infrastructure-spotlight-eu-ai-act-draft-guidelines-on-high-risk-ai-classification))

Annex III systems can escape high-risk status only if they genuinely do not pose a significant risk to health, safety or fundamental rights — for example, where the AI performs a narrow procedural task or merely improves a completed human activity. That escape is not a shrug; it is a **documented determination** you have to be able to defend.

This is the natural seam between the AI Act and the operational-security regimes. A grid operator's SCADA-adjacent AI can be an Annex III safety component *and* sit inside a system governed by [NIS2](/en/nis2). The classification questions and the security questions are asked of the same asset.

### The Article 6(3) escape — and why it is not a shrug

Route 2 has a release valve, and it is worth understanding precisely, because it is the provision most often invoked and most often misapplied. **Article 6(3)** says an AI system listed in Annex III is **not** high-risk if it does not pose a significant risk of harm to health, safety or fundamental rights — *including by not materially influencing the outcome of decision-making* — where **any one** of four conditions is met. ([Article 6, EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/6/))

```compare
Falls OUT of high-risk (Art. 6(3))
- **(a) Narrow procedural task** — the AI does something bounded and mechanical, e.g. structuring or transforming data to a fixed template
- **(b) Improves a completed human activity** — it polishes or refines output a human has already produced, without setting the direction
- **(c) Detects decision-making patterns / deviations** — it flags divergence from a prior human pattern but is *not* meant to replace or influence the human assessment without proper review
- **(d) Performs a preparatory task** — it prepares an input for an assessment, but does not itself make the assessment
---
Stays IN high-risk
- The AI **profiles a natural person** — profiling always keeps a system high-risk, no derogation available
- The AI **materially influences the outcome** of a safety or rights-relevant decision
- The AI **replaces** meaningful human judgement in the loop
- You cannot **document and defend** why one of the four conditions genuinely applies
```

Two cautions make the difference between a defensible classification and a costly mistake. First, the Commission's guidance is explicit that the four conditions must be **interpreted narrowly** — they are exits for genuinely peripheral AI, not a loophole to reclassify a system you would rather not govern. Second, if you rely on Article 6(3) you must **register** the system and **record your assessment** before placing it on the market or putting it into service; the burden of proof sits with you, and a market-surveillance authority can demand the reasoning. ([Data Protection Report, applying the Commission's guidelines](https://www.dataprotectionreport.com/2026/05/is-my-use-case-a-high-risk-ai-system-applying-the-commissions-guidelines-and-next-steps/)) In an OT setting the honest read is that a system genuinely wired into a *safety component* rarely qualifies — the moment its output can move a hazard, it is materially influencing an outcome the law cares about.

## What high-risk systems must do — Articles 8–15

High-risk AI systems must be built and operated against a defined set of requirements. Read Articles 8–15 as a lifecycle, not a checklist you clear once.

| Article | Requirement | What it means on the ground |
|---|---|---|
| **9** | Risk management system | Continuous, across the whole lifecycle — identify, evaluate, mitigate, repeat. |
| **10** | Data & data governance | Training/validation/test data fit for purpose, representative, examined for bias and gaps. |
| **11** | Technical documentation | The evidentiary file that demonstrates conformity — kept current. |
| **12** | Record-keeping / logging | Automatic logging of events over the system's lifetime, enabling traceability. |
| **13** | Transparency & instructions for use | Deployers get clear, complete instructions — including accuracy metrics and limits. |
| **14** | Human oversight | Designed *in*, so a competent person can understand, intervene, and stop the system. |
| **15** | Accuracy, robustness & cybersecurity | The security backbone — see below. |

### Article 15 — where AI governance meets OT security

Article 15 is the requirement OT teams should highlight. High-risk systems must achieve an appropriate level of **accuracy** (with the metrics declared in the instructions for use), **robustness** (resilience to errors, faults, inconsistencies and feedback loops, with redundancy where appropriate), and **cybersecurity** (resilience against attempts by unauthorised parties to alter the system's use, outputs or behaviour by exploiting its vulnerabilities). ([Article 15, AI Act Service Desk](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-15))

Crucially, Article 15 names AI-specific attack classes and requires measures — where appropriate — to prevent, detect, respond to, resolve and control for them:

- **Data poisoning** — corrupting the training dataset so the model learns the attacker's behaviour. For a model that will govern a process, a poisoned training set is a pre-installed backdoor.
- **Model poisoning** — tampering with pre-trained components pulled into training. Your supply chain is now part of your attack surface.
- **Adversarial examples / model evasion** — inputs crafted to make the model err. A physical sticker, a lighting change, a spoofed sensor reading that flips a classifier at exactly the wrong moment.
- **Confidentiality attacks and model flaws** — extraction, inversion, and the exploitation of latent defects.

> [!TIP]
> In IT, a manipulated model produces a wrong answer on a screen. In OT, **a manipulated model is a manipulated process.** An adversarial input that fools a vision-based safety trip, or a poisoned model that misjudges a hazardous condition, is a physical-safety event — not a data-quality issue. This is why Article 15 belongs in your control-system security programme, mapped through methods like [IEC 62443](/en/iec-62443), and not filed away as an AI-team paperwork exercise. It is also why the CRA and Article 15 overlap: both demand security-by-design for the digital components inside your products.

### Article 9 — a risk-management system that never closes

Article 9 is the spine the other requirements hang from. It demands a **continuous, iterative** risk-management process running across the entire lifecycle of a high-risk system — not a one-time assessment filed at launch. You identify and analyse the known and reasonably foreseeable risks the system can pose to health, safety and fundamental rights; you estimate the risks that emerge from *intended use* and from *reasonably foreseeable misuse*; you evaluate risks from post-market monitoring data; and you adopt targeted measures to manage them. For OT, the phrase that does the work is "reasonably foreseeable misuse." A vision model trained on a clean, well-lit line will meet a night shift, a dirty lens, a swapped fixture and an operator who leans a part against the housing to save a second — and the risk file has to have imagined that world, not the demo. Article 9 also pushes you toward testing against **defined metrics and probabilistic thresholds** appropriate to the intended purpose, which is exactly where a model's failure modes stop being a research curiosity and start being a documented safety boundary.

### Article 10 — data governance, where the risk is often born

Article 10 requires that training, validation and testing datasets be **relevant, sufficiently representative, and to the best extent possible free of errors and complete** in view of the intended purpose, with appropriate attention to the specific setting in which the system will be used. It obliges you to examine datasets for **bias** that could affect health, safety or fundamental rights, and to identify gaps and shortcomings. In an industrial context the fundamental-rights framing feels distant, but the representativeness requirement is pure engineering: a defect-detection model trained only on summer product, or on one supplier's raw material, or on a single machine's tolerances, is not "representative" of the process it will police — and that gap is where both quality failures and Article 10 non-conformities are born. Good data governance here is the same discipline that makes the model *work*; the Act simply makes it auditable.

### Article 14 — human oversight, and the automation-bias trap

Article 14 requires that high-risk systems be designed so that they can be **effectively overseen by natural persons** during use — with the interface, the information and the tooling a person actually needs to understand the system's limits, watch for signs of anomalous behaviour, correctly interpret its output, decide *not* to use it in a given case, and **intervene or stop** it. The subtle requirement is guarding against **automation bias**: the well-documented human tendency to over-trust a confident machine, especially under time pressure. A "human in the loop" who rubber-stamps whatever the model says at line speed is not oversight in the sense Article 14 means. In a control room, meaningful oversight means the operator can see *why* the system acted, has the authority and the physical means to override it, and has been trained to distrust it at the right moments. This is where AI governance and OT human-factors engineering are the same conversation — and where the [Cyber Digital Twin](/en/cyber-digital-twin) view of what-connects-to-what helps an operator reason about a model's blast radius before, not during, an incident.

## Providers versus deployers

The Act splits duties by role, and getting your role right decides your obligations. The distinction is not academic — the same organisation can be a deployer of one system and, without meaning to, the provider of another.

| | **Provider** (Art. 16) | **Deployer** (Art. 26) |
|---|---|---|
| Who | Develops the AI or has it developed, and places it on the market / puts it into service under its own name | Uses a high-risk AI system under its own authority — most industrial operators |
| Core duties | Quality management system; full technical documentation; conformity assessment; EU declaration of conformity; CE marking; registration in the EU database; post-market monitoring | Use per instructions; ensure human oversight by competent people; ensure input data is relevant/representative; monitor operation, suspend and report on emerging risk; keep logs (min. 6 months) |
| Typical actor in OT | OEM, machine builder, integrator, model vendor | Plant operator, utility, asset owner |
| The trap | — | Substantially modify, retrain, or rebrand a high-risk system and you may **become the provider** — inheriting the full provider obligations |

**Providers** carry the weight, and in practice that is your OEM, integrator or model vendor. ([Article 16](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/16/)) **Deployers** carry a lighter but concrete set of duties, and where you deploy AI that affects workers, you may owe them information as well. ([Article 26](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/26/)) The line between the two is the one to watch at procurement and at every firmware upgrade: the moment you retrain a vendor's safety model on your own data, you have very likely stepped across it.

### The modification trap, spelled out

Article 25 is where a deployer quietly turns into a provider. You inherit the **full provider obligations** for a high-risk system if you **put your own name or trademark on it**, if you make a **substantial modification** that keeps it high-risk, or if you **change its intended purpose** such that a previously non-high-risk system becomes high-risk. In an OT context all three are ordinary maintenance events dressed as legal thresholds.

```compare
Stays a deployer (Art. 26 duties)
- Uses the system **as instructed** by the provider
- Applies vendor updates and patches within the intended purpose
- Feeds it representative input data and monitors output
- Keeps logs, ensures competent human oversight, reports emerging risk
---
Becomes a provider (Art. 25 → Art. 16 duties)
- **Retrains** the model on its own data to change performance
- **Re-brands** the system or ships it onward under its own name
- **Repurposes** it — a quality model rewired to make a safety decision
- **Substantially modifies** it beyond the provider's declared design
```

The reason this matters is cost and liability: the provider owns conformity assessment, the technical file, the declaration of conformity, post-market monitoring and the Article 15 evidence. Crossing the line by accident — a well-meant retrain to reduce nuisance trips — can transfer that entire burden to you without anyone signing anything. Check before you modify; document the decision either way.

## A note on general-purpose AI

Separate from the risk tiers, the Act sets rules for **general-purpose AI (GPAI) models** — the large foundation models that can be adapted to many tasks. Their obligations (technical documentation, a copyright-compliance policy, a public summary of training data, and cooperation with the AI Office) applied from **2 August 2025**, and the Commission — through the AI Office — can supervise and fine GPAI providers directly under Article 101.

A second, heavier tier sits on top: models with **systemic risk**. Under **Article 51**, a GPAI model is presumed to carry systemic risk when the cumulative compute used for its training exceeds **10²⁵ floating-point operations (FLOPs)** — a threshold aimed at the largest frontier models. Those providers take on extra duties: model evaluation and adversarial testing (red-teaming), systemic-risk assessment and mitigation, serious-incident tracking and reporting, and a baseline of cybersecurity for the model and its physical infrastructure. Many providers meet these through the **GPAI Code of Practice**, the co-regulatory instrument the Commission facilitated to give a presumption of compliance.

For an industrial operator this is mostly upstream — you consume GPAI through tools rather than train it — but the seam matters in two places. First, if you **fine-tune a foundation model and embed it in a product** or place it on the market under your own name, the provider questions come back into view, and depending on the compute involved you could even inherit downstream GPAI duties. Second, a GPAI-powered assistant that you point at operational data is a **data-governance and confidentiality** decision before it is a convenience — which is exactly the kind of "shadow AI" exposure that turns up uninventoried until someone goes looking.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Watch for **"shadow AI"** on the OT side of the house. Engineers pasting process logs into a public chatbot to debug a fault, a vendor tool quietly calling a hosted model, an assistant fine-tuned on your maintenance history — each is an AI system that belongs on the inventory and may carry obligations (literacy, transparency, confidentiality, and occasionally more). You cannot classify or govern what nobody has written down.

## AI literacy is already law — Article 4

Amid the debate over deferred high-risk dates, one live obligation is easy to miss: **Article 4** requires providers and deployers to ensure a **sufficient level of AI literacy** among their staff and anyone operating AI systems on their behalf, and it has applied since **2 February 2025**. It is not tied to the high-risk tier and it was **not** deferred by the Omnibus.

"Sufficient" is proportionate to context: it scales with the person's role, the systems they touch, and who is affected. For an industrial operator that means the people who run an AI-assisted inspection cell, tune an adaptive controller, or interpret a model's output should understand — at a level fit for their job — what the system does, where it fails, and when to distrust it. This is the human-factors counterpart to Article 14's oversight requirement: oversight only works if the person overseeing has the literacy to exercise it. A short, role-scoped programme with a record of who was trained and on what is both the compliance artefact and the thing that actually reduces risk on the floor.

## Fundamental-rights framing and the FRIA

The AI Act is, at its root, a fundamental-rights instrument, and that shows up in one deployer obligation worth flagging even though it rarely bites in pure OT: certain deployers of high-risk systems — notably public bodies and some providers of essential services — must carry out a **fundamental-rights impact assessment (FRIA)** under Article 27 before first use, describing the process, the affected persons, the risks, and the human-oversight and governance measures. For a purely mechanical safety component the fundamental-rights surface is small; for AI that touches workers, access, or the public — a utility's customer-affecting decision system, workforce monitoring — it is real, and it stacks on top of any GDPR obligation rather than replacing it. The safe posture is to ask the FRIA question during classification rather than discover it during an audit.

## Penalties

Article 99 sets the ceilings, and they are the highest in EU digital law. Like the GDPR and NIS2, the structure is deliberately turnover-linked so that non-compliance registers as a board-level financial risk, not a line item.

| Breach | Maximum fine | Article |
|---|---|---|
| Prohibited practices | **€35,000,000 or 7%** of total worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher | Art. 5 → Art. 99 |
| Breach of other obligations (providers, deployers, importers, distributors, notified bodies, transparency) | **€15,000,000 or 3%** of worldwide turnover | Art. 99 |
| Supplying incorrect, incomplete or misleading information to authorities / notified bodies | **€7,500,000 or 1%** of worldwide turnover | Art. 99 |
| GPAI model provider infringements | **€15,000,000 or 3%** of worldwide turnover | Art. 101 |

Fines are proportionate, and for SMEs and start-ups the figure is capped at whichever of the percentage or the absolute amount is **lower** — a deliberate softening for smaller firms. ([Article 99](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/99/); [Article 101](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-101))

## Conformity assessment, CE marking and the EU database

A high-risk system does not reach the market on the strength of good intentions. Before it is placed on the market or put into service, the provider must run a **conformity assessment** — the formal check that Articles 8–15 are met — and the route depends on how the system is classified.

For most **Annex III** high-risk systems, the Act allows conformity assessment based on **internal control (Annex VI)**: the provider itself verifies that its quality-management system and technical documentation satisfy the requirements, without a third party. For certain systems — notably some biometric use-cases — assessment must instead involve a **notified body (Annex VII)**, an accredited independent assessor. For **Annex I** product-embedded AI, the AI conformity check is folded into the **existing product conformity assessment** under the relevant harmonisation law (so a machine's AI safety component is assessed through the Machinery Regulation's own procedure, not a separate parallel one). ([Article 43, EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/43/))

The output of a successful assessment is a chain of tangible artefacts:

| Step | What it is | Who holds it |
|---|---|---|
| **Technical documentation (Annex IV)** | The evidentiary file proving conformity | Provider, kept current |
| **EU declaration of conformity** | The provider's signed legal statement of compliance | Provider |
| **CE marking** | The visible mark that the product may circulate in the EU | On the product / accompanying docs |
| **Registration in the EU database** | Standalone Annex III systems logged before market entry | Provider (and deployers, for some public-authority uses) |
| **Post-market monitoring** | Ongoing collection of performance and incident data | Provider |

The practical implication for a deployer is a short procurement checklist that carries real weight: **is there a declaration of conformity, is the system CE-marked, and can the provider produce the instructions for use with the accuracy metrics and limits Article 13 requires?** If the answer is no, you are either not looking at a compliant high-risk system, or you are closer to being its provider than you think.

## Harmonised standards and the presumption of conformity

Nobody wants to argue Articles 8–15 from first principles for every system. The Act uses the classic **New Legislative Framework** mechanism: where a provider follows a **harmonised standard** whose reference has been published in the Official Journal, the system enjoys a **presumption of conformity** with the corresponding requirements. In other words, meet the standard and the burden of proving compliance largely lifts. The standards themselves are being developed by **CEN-CENELEC (Joint Technical Committee 21)** at the Commission's request, covering risk management, data quality, robustness, cybersecurity, transparency and human oversight for AI.

For OT this is the pragmatic path, and it dovetails with the security-engineering standards you may already use. Article 15's cybersecurity requirement, in particular, is where AI-specific standards and control-system security standards like [IEC 62443](/en/iec-62443) converge: the AI harmonised standards give you the presumption of conformity, while 62443's zones, conduits and security-level framework give you the *method* to demonstrate the robustness and cybersecurity the standard expects. Building your evidence once, against both, is far cheaper than building it twice.

## The Machinery Regulation connection

The AI Act does not stand alone. The **Machinery Regulation (EU) 2023/1230** — which replaces the old Machinery Directive and applies from **20 January 2027** — modernises machine safety for a world of software, connectivity and AI, and for the first time makes **cybersecurity an essential health-and-safety requirement**. ([EUR-Lex 2023/1230](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1230/oj/eng); [Nemko](https://www.nemko.com/blog/eu-machinery-regulation-2023/1230))

The revised Annex III essential requirements now address AI behaviour, cybersecurity, human-robot collaboration, IoT connectivity, the safety impact of software updates and functional safety. In plain terms: safety-related control systems and software must be immune to both accidental failure *and* deliberate attack, and connecting a device to a machine must not create a hazard. Cybersecurity in machinery is no longer optional — it is part of the safety case.

The two laws are stitched together on purpose. A safety-related AI component in a machine is high-risk under the AI Act, and the machine itself must satisfy the Machinery Regulation's safety and security requirements. The EU has moved explicitly to clarify the overlap so that a manufacturer does not face two contradictory conformity paths for one machine. ([IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/eu-agrees-to-amend-ai-act-clarifies-overlap-with-machinery-rules)) For a machine builder or an operator commissioning new equipment, the compliant route runs through **both at once** — which is exactly why the classification work and the security engineering want to happen in the same room. See the [Machinery Regulation](/en/machine-act) page for the machine-safety side of this story.

## A worked example: an AI vision trip on a 400-tonne press

Abstraction hides the decisions. Walk one concrete system through the whole chain and the Act stops being a wall of articles.

A stamping line runs a **400-tonne mechanical press**. To protect operators, the builder replaces the fixed light curtain with an **AI vision system** that watches the danger zone and **commands the press to stop** if it detects a hand, arm or body inside the guarded area during the stroke. It learns to distinguish a hand from a shadow, a glove from a part, steam from an intrusion.

- **Is it high-risk?** Yes — via **Route 1 (Annex I)**. The vision system is a **safety component of machinery** (Reg. (EU) 2023/1230), and machinery is Annex I harmonisation law. The classification is automatic; there is no Article 6(3) escape, because the model's output *materially influences* whether a hazardous motion stops. The moment its decision can stop the press, it is doing safety-relevant work.
- **Who is the provider?** The **machine builder** that integrates the vision system and places the press on the market under its own name. It owns the technical documentation, the risk-management file (Article 9), the data governance for the training set (Article 10), the declaration of conformity and CE marking.
- **What does Article 15 demand?** That the model be **accurate** (a declared, tested detection rate under real lighting, dust and speed), **robust** (fails safe — a dropped frame, an occluded lens or an out-of-distribution input must trip the press, not wave it through), and **cyber-secure** (an attacker must not be able to feed a spoofed frame, poison the model, or craft an **adversarial patch** — a sticker or pattern that makes the model classify a hand as background at exactly the wrong instant).
- **Where does the Machinery Regulation bite?** In parallel. The **safety-related control system** must meet the essential health-and-safety requirements — including the new **cybersecurity** requirement — and the AI conformity check folds into the machine's own conformity assessment rather than running as a separate track.
- **What if the operator retrains it?** If the plant operator **retrains the model on its own product** to cut false trips, it may **substantially modify** the system and **become the provider** — inheriting the full documentation, conformity and Article 15 burden it thought belonged to the builder.
- **Where does the security programme live?** The adversarial-patch and data-poisoning risks are **OT threats**, mapped through [IEC 62443](/en/iec-62443) zones and conduits and sitting on the same control-system risk register as remote-access exposure and ransomware — not in a separate AI silo.

One press, one model, and four regimes brushing against it: the AI Act, the Machinery Regulation, [NIS2](/en/nis2) at the operator, and the CRA on the digital components inside. This is why OXOT argues for answering them with **one coherent model of the plant**, not four disconnected projects.

## Sector-specific notes

The classification logic is common, but where AI lands differs by sector:

- **Energy and grid.** AI in substation automation, DER orchestration and load forecasting can be an **Annex III** safety component in electricity supply. Availability dominates, and a manipulated forecast or protection-adjacent model is a stability risk, not just a data-quality one.
- **Water and wastewater.** Dosing optimisation and anomaly detection sit close to public-health outcomes; an AI that adjusts a chemical setpoint is materially influencing a safety-relevant process, which pulls it toward high-risk.
- **Discrete manufacturing.** The Annex I / machinery route is the common one: vision-based safety trips, AI-guided cobots, adaptive controllers on hazardous motions. The provider/deployer trap around retraining is most acute here.
- **Pharma and med-manufacturing.** AI in devices and production overlaps the **Medical Devices / IVD** regulations (also Annex I), stacking conformity regimes on the same system.
- **Chemical and process.** AI adjacent to **safety-instrumented systems** must be reconciled with functional-safety regimes — a natural fit for the risk-based zones of IEC 62443 rather than a bolt-on.

## What it means for OT — and for your role

The honest headline bears repeating: **most industrial AI is not high-risk.** The work is in finding the AI that is, classifying it correctly, and governing it without smothering useful innovation. Different people in the organisation feel that work differently.

**If you are a CISO or AI-governance lead**, the AI Act extends your remit into models embedded in OT, and Article 15 makes model robustness and cybersecurity explicitly your problem. You need an inventory of AI systems, a defensible classification for each, and evidence that the high-risk few are governed — including against data poisoning and adversarial manipulation.

**If you are an operations or engineering manager**, the questions become concrete at procurement and at every upgrade: Is this AI a safety component? Who is the provider? Is there a declaration of conformity and a CE marking? Does retraining or modifying it turn *us* into the provider?

**If you sit on the board**, the AI Act adds a second turnover-linked penalty regime on top of NIS2, and the accountability for classification and governance ultimately rests with you. The reassuring part is that the scope is narrower than the headlines suggest; the uncomfortable part is that "we didn't know we had that AI" is not a defence.

## A practical approach — inventory, classify, govern

1. **Inventory your AI.** You cannot classify what you have not listed. Build a register of AI systems across IT and OT, including embedded models inside drives, controllers and vision cells, and vendor-supplied models you may not think of as "AI."
2. **Classify each system.** For each, decide: prohibited, high-risk (via Annex I or Annex III), limited-risk, or minimal-risk — and **document the reasoning**, especially where you conclude a system is *not* high-risk. The Act expects you to be able to justify that call.
3. **Fix your role.** For each high-risk system, establish whether you are provider or deployer, and confirm the provider has done their part — conformity assessment, CE marking, documentation, declaration of conformity.
4. **Govern the high-risk few.** Put human oversight, logging, monitoring and — for anything in a control or safety loop — Article 15 robustness and cybersecurity controls in place. Test the model against adversarial inputs, not just nominal ones.
5. **Align with your OT security programme.** Treat AI robustness as part of control-system security, not a separate silo. Data poisoning and model manipulation are OT threats now, and they belong on the same risk register as ransomware and remote-access exposure. See [Frameworks](/en/frameworks) for how the regimes fit together.

## How OXOT helps

AI classification and Article 15 robustness are, at their core, questions about where AI sits in your operational risk picture — which is precisely what OXOT models. Our **[Cyber Digital Twin](/en/cyber-digital-twin)** gives you a structured, living view of your OT estate, including where AI components sit relative to safety and control functions, so you can find the high-risk few and govern the cybersecurity of the models that actually matter. Our OT security assessments and programmes fold AI robustness into your broader control-system security, and our **[IEC 62443](/en/iec-62443)** alignment gives you an engineering method for demonstrating that the security requirements — Article 15's included — are met. Where the AI Act meets the CRA, [NIS2](/en/nis2) and the [Machinery Regulation](/en/machine-act), we help you answer all four with one coherent view instead of four disconnected projects.

## Frequently asked questions

**Is our predictive-maintenance model high-risk?**
Almost certainly not, if it only informs maintenance and does not act as a safety component or control a hazardous process. But document that conclusion — the Act expects you to justify a not-high-risk classification, and "we assumed so" is not documentation.

**We buy machines with AI inside from an OEM. Are we the provider?**
Usually the OEM is the provider. But if you substantially modify the AI, retrain it on your own data, or place it on the market under your own name, you can become the provider and inherit those obligations. Check before you modify — the trap springs quietly.

**How does the AI Act relate to NIS2, the CRA and the Machinery Regulation?**
They stack. [NIS2](/en/nis2) governs how you operate your systems; the CRA governs the security of products with digital elements; the [Machinery Regulation](/en/machine-act) makes cybersecurity a machine-safety requirement; and the AI Act governs AI systems specifically, with Article 15 as the security bridge. A safety-related industrial AI can be touched by all four at once.

**The high-risk deadlines moved — do I have more time?**
Yes, and no. The Digital Omnibus deferred standalone Annex III systems to 2 December 2027 and product-embedded Annex I AI to 2 August 2028 — but those dates are provisional until the amending act is published, and the prohibitions and AI-literacy duties already apply. Inventory and classification take longer than the paperwork that follows, so starting now is the cheap option.

**Does the Act care which AI technique we used?**
No. It is technology-neutral. A rule-based system and a deep neural network are treated the same if they do the same safety-relevant job in the same place. What matters is the *function and context*, not the algorithm.

**Our Annex III system does a "narrow task" — can we skip high-risk?**
Possibly, under the Article 6(3) derogation — but only if you can genuinely place it in one of the four conditions (narrow procedural task, improving a completed human activity, detecting patterns without replacing human judgement, or a preparatory task) *and* it does not profile a person or materially influence a safety- or rights-relevant outcome. You must register the system and record the assessment first, and the conditions are interpreted narrowly. For a real safety component the exit rarely applies.

**Do we need a notified body to assess our high-risk AI?**
Usually not for industrial systems. Most Annex III systems use internal-control conformity assessment (Annex VI); a notified body (Annex VII) is required mainly for certain biometric use-cases. For AI embedded in machinery (Annex I), the AI check is folded into the machine's existing conformity assessment rather than adding a separate one.

**Is following a standard enough to comply?**
Following a harmonised standard whose reference is published in the Official Journal gives a **presumption of conformity** with the matching requirements — which shifts the burden strongly in your favour, though a market-surveillance authority can still investigate. The AI standards are being written by CEN-CENELEC JTC 21, and for Article 15 cybersecurity they align well with IEC 62443.

**What about staff who just use an AI tool — any obligation now?**
Yes. The Article 4 AI-literacy duty is live and was not deferred. Anyone operating AI on your behalf needs a level of understanding proportionate to their role. A short, role-scoped training programme with a record of completion is the expected artefact.
